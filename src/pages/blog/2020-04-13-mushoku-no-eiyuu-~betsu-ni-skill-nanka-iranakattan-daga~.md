**\[Episode 18] *Order up and wait***

No?

It's impossible to use a wild, legendary demon as a squire when it's so difficult to even reach the Demon Rock.

''Hmmm............

What's more, you're a demon trainer?

Yes.

Although he didn't belong to a guild yet, he couldn't be wrong since he had two demons in tow.

What's wrong with the demon?

There's one in here.

...Domo.

I point to Matty, who was drifting nearby.

So she finally realized her existence.

A weakened demon has such a thin presence that it is hard for people to notice it like a spirit or fairy.

What, is that a demon?

Yes.

...can you fight?

You're not going to be much of a fighting force in this state.

She wrinkled her brow for a moment before finally clapping her hands with a snap.

''So you're going to meet up with the party of adventurers who are going to cooperate with you?

I won't.

"How the hell are you going to get to the Demon Rock!

I'm going to go as normal, aren't I?

On top of that, using a legendary demon as a follower is just another dream come true! On top of that, as soon as we cross the border with the safe zone, we'll be attacked by demons!

According to her, the demons inhabiting this plain were powerful, even if they were far from the central demon rock.

That's why demon trainers who don't have the strength to fight will either ask a party of adventurers to help them, or use a strong enough demon as a follower before challenging them.

I see.

I see...normally, if you are a trainer, you should have that much knowledge...but...

She exhales in disbelief.

And then, when

''Arcia-chan, it's been a long time, I've missed you!

A young man rushed into the store with a cheerful voice.

His age was in his mid-twenties.

He is stocky and of medium height, and wears a magnificent embroidered and lofty robe.

'...here we are again.

The girl in the shop mutters with a blatantly disgusted look on her face.

Apparently, his name is Ursia.

Do you know him?

He's a regular, and he's been making advances on me several times, but I can't refuse him, and he's very persistent, and I heard that he's a famous demon trainer in Demon City, but he's not my type because of his face and personality.

Following the young man, several demons entered the store.

They must be his followers.

There are wolf demons, gorilla demons, and large demons such as ogres and minotaurs.

But none of them are normal, common individuals.

The Ogre has one horn, while the Minotaur has an unusual horn shape.

It may be a demon peculiar to this plains.

Who is this guy?

The young man, who had come up to me, suddenly looked grumpy when he noticed me.

Who's the customer?

''Hahahaha, that's right, I thought you had a boyfriend!

When Aasia responded with a half-eyed look, the young man chuckled like that.

'...even if you could, it's none of your business, anyway.

The young man announced triumphantly, as if he hadn't heard Aasia's murmur.

Actually, I've managed to get a very rare demon to follow me this time! Come on in, Griz!

"Curl....

He answered the young man's call, and entered the store stealthily, a huge bear with a well-developed arm.

Ursia gasped.

"This is....

The Arm Grizzly, that's a rare A! It's so strong and so difficult to train, it took me a whole day to train it!

The giant bear has arms longer than its legs attached to the ground, but its head is still just above the ceiling.

If I were to stand up, my head would certainly be on the ceiling.

"Curl........................

What's more, he doesn't like this small space, and he's gurgling uncomfortably.

''Hey, hey, are you okay? You're not going to rampage in the store, are you?

Ha-ha-ha, don't worry about it, because I'm the one who disciplined you!

The young man laughed lightly and tapped his chest as he questioned Ursia anxiously.

But just then, the giant bear lightly swung his right arm.

Thump thump!

The tables and chairs that were nearby were blown away, and there was a loud clang.

''Ha, ha, ha.......

The young man's grin twitched slightly.

Hurry up and let me out....!

''No, it's okay, I'm just a little excited...it won't be long before it calms down...''

"Curl.

Zugashaaaan!

Another table was sacrificed.

Still, there was no sign of the giant bear settling down.

Thinking it's not a good idea, the young man urges the giant bear to take him out of the store.

But the giant bear didn't comply and instead went into the back of the store.

"Hee!

Ursia hurriedly runs away.

The young man tried to restrain himself, but the giant bear would not listen to him.

The giant bear is heading towards the kitchen, apparently.

There's a delicious smell in the air, and maybe I'm being lured by it.

"Gururururururururu.

But there I was on the way to the kitchen, sitting and waiting for the food to be served.

The giant bear, just out of the way, tried to swat the whole table away with an arm thicker than a log.

Oh, look out, run!

Gosh.

''ugh!''

I said, "I'll take the giant bear's arm in one hand and stop it.

If you want to eat, you're going to have to order and wait.
